# WatsonIBIS

The Watson project is a Javascipt tool which can be used to visualize hyperbolic trees.
The is proejct is mainly inspired by Christophe Bouthier's project (written in Java), which can be found here: https://sourceforge.net/projects/hypertree/

The goal is to allow us to represent the basic structure of an Issue Based Indormation System : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Issue-Based_Information_System
The main principle of this system, invented by Werner Kunz and Horst Rittel, is to represent issues, associated with answers, which are associated with arguments.

This project <b>is a draft</b>

At the moment, there is no database behind this app, but only a static jso file, that's the reason why we can't add a new publication (the formular is now useless)
